        Plugin for the DS-30

  Copyright (C) 2019  SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION


  SUMMARY
  =======
    This plugin converts between the native protocol of the supported
    devices and the ESC/I protocol.  The latter protocol is supported
    by the SANE 'epkowa' backend, part of Image Scan!, and some other
    SANE backends.  However, only the 'epkowa' backend provides the
    hooks needed to use this plugin.

    You only need this plugin if you have one of the following models:
     - Epson DS-30

INSTALLATION
============

  BINARY PACKAGES
  ---------------
    For help on installation of Debian and RPM binary packages refer to
    your distribution's documentation.  In most graphical environments
    just double clicking does the right thing.  If that does not work
    for you, you can always install from a command line with the least
    common denominator tools as follows:

    For Debian packages:

      # dpkg --install $filename.deb

    For RPM packages:

      # rpm --upgrade $filename.rpm

    Both commands require root user privileges and assume that package
    dependencies have been taken care of already.
